# Python Scripts for Malware Development
This repository contains three Python scripts for a simple malware implementation. The malware is designed to establish a connection with a server and send system information. The server can send two commands: 'exit' to terminate the connection and 'sysinfo' to request the system information from the client.

# Prerequisites
The malware requires a server to connect to. Before running the malware, make sure to set up a server and update the server_ip and server_port variables in the client.py script accordingly.

# Files
malware.py: This script establishes a connection with the server, sends the system information to the server and waits for commands from the server.

serverUi.py: This script sets up a server and listens for incoming connections from clients. It receives the system information from the client and can send two commands to the client: 'exit' to terminate the connection and 'sysinfo' to request the system information.

sysinfo.py: This script contains a function that gathers system information such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage.

# Usage
Set up the server by running the serverUi.py script.

Update the server_ip and server_port variables in the client.py script with the appropriate values for the server.

Run the malware.py script on the target system to establish a connection with the server.

The client will send the system information to the server upon connection and wait for commands from the server.

The server can send two commands to the client: 'exit' to terminate the connection and 'sysinfo' to request the system information.

The sysinfo.py script can be modified to include additional system information as needed.
